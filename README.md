## This is PowerBi end to end project on personal finance.

In my Personal Finance Dashboard, I’ve created a comprehensive tool to help me track, analyze, and manage my finances with ease.

Here’s a concise breakdown of my Personal Finance Dashboard project:

**Account Balances**: I have a quick overview of my SBI, IB, and total balances to keep track of my financial status at a glance.

**Expense vs. Investment**: The dashboard shows me what percentage of my money goes into expenses versus investments, helping me balance spending and saving.

**Category Filtering**: I can filter expenses by categories like Bills, Lifestyle, and Entertainment to focus on specific spending areas.

**Spending & Credit Analytics**: Charts provide daily and monthly views of my expenses and credits by category, allowing me to see trends over time.

**Detailed Transaction Table**: This table displays each transaction with details on date, type, category, and amount, making it easy to review individual transactions.

**Summary Insights**: Key insights highlight major patterns, like how much I’ve lent to friends or what portion of my spending is in Miscellaneous.

**Interactive Filtering**: I can filter by specific months and transaction types, helping me focus on the data that matters most at any given time.

This dashboard is my main tool for tracking, analyzing, and optimizing my finances efficiently!
